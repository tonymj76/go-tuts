rune is a character like a-z and *, any character
rune is an alias for int32 which point to a int of some sort

bit which is 0 and 1
8bits of 0s and 1s make up 1byte
int32 = 32 bits
how many bytes in 32 bits? (32/8 = bytes) 4bytes
UTF-8 is a 4 byte coding scheme
we have 0s and 1s to represent character in computer so if we have 2bits/int
we can represent 2^2 = 4 char so we have int32 which means we have 2^32 ways to represent a character.

strings are collection of runes.... eg []byte("hello") due to string are made of character this return a slice
of bits that the character represent

definition of Rune
rune in Go is a data type that stores codes that represent Unicode characters.
Unicode is actually the collection of all possible characters present in the whole world.
